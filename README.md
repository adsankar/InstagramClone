# Instagram Clone

A class project for implementing image filters

## Project Screen Shots

#### Filter applied to tree image:   

![tree before and after](/screens/tree-before-after.png?raw=true "Tree before and after")

#### Filter applied to flower image:   

![flower before and after](/screens/flower-before-after.png?raw=true "Flower before and after")

## Technnologies used

- Java Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT)
- Java Swing

## Installation and Setup Instructions

- Clone down this repository. You will need Java installed on your machine.  
- Run as a Java program or run the main class through an IDE of your choice

## Reflection/Approach

This was part of a class project (2D Graphics), and the intent was to implement image filtering algorithms. The result is similar to the filtering that applications such as Instagram or Photoshop utilize. The Kelvin filter was used, and another filter to add an image border was implemented. To reduce complexity, only basic Java libraries, such as AWT and Swing, were used.
